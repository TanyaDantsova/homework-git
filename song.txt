You're far away, but it's like you're outside my window.
I'm glad to see you, even if it's just a glimpse.
But I'm thrown in "Ignore" when I'm not quiet,
I'm telling you, ooh

You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe
This could be the end
It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real
Well I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Our memories
Well, they can be inviting
But some are altogether
Mighty frightening
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands
I sit and cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts (no, no, no)
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
